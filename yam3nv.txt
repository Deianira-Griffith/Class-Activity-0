I've taken EE CompArch and OS, and I've also taken and TAd EAR1 and EAR2. I'm involved in a research project that is using wearable devices and deployable IoT sensors to monitor and predict pain episodes in cancer patients. I have done the hardware and software for the IoT sensors using the Raspberry Pi Zero W on a Broadcom BCM2835 SoC. I've also done robotics work in the past.
