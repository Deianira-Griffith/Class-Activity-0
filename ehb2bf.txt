I am a graduate student in the computer science department. I have taken classes in computer architecture and operating sytems which both used C and x86 Assembly. I've also 
interned at an aerospace startup company where I was writing some embedded systems code that ran on a PIC 
microcontroler.

My intest in real time embedded systems stems from my experiences at a startup satellite company. Since my interests are primarily in the aerospace field,
I want to learn how to develop systems that are reliable in harsh and computationally limited environment of space. 
My parents are both software engineers who do real time embedded software for their jobs and they expressed the 
importance for me to learn how to develop these kinds of systems if I want to be a successful and well rounded 
engineer. I want to learn about real time operating systems, and how they handle and respond to exceptions with their ISR's in a timely manner. Also I want to learn
about concurrency in real time embedded systems and how threads are managed and switched to in a highly time constrained environment.
