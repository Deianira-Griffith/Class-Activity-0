Conner Ward (cjw5db)

I have taken courses in computer architecture, operating systems, and high
performance computing, also serving as a Teaching Assistant for the former two
courses. I do not have any experience with embedded systems, or physically
interacting with hardware for that matter. I have worked with many programming
languages, but most significantly with C and Ruby.

I have a wide array of interests within CS, but overall enjoy learning new
technologies and solving difficult problems. My favorite projects have focused
on high performance heterogeneous systems, large-scale web applications, and
general optimization.  I am excited to learn more about hardware in this class,
to design software with physical constraints, and to create a cool project.
