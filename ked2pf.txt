Regarding coursework, the only relevant classes I have taken are Embedded Computing and Robotics 1 and 2, which both program in C onto an MSP432. In the Mechatronics and Robotics Society here at UVA, I've programmed onto an STM32-based development board in C# for robotics applications, mostly translating serial instructions to motor control outputs. During my internship over the summer, I had the opportunity to design a pretty simple embedded system which featured a PIC32 programmed in C.
I am very interested in embedded system design and hope to make that my career after graduation. I enjoy both the physical hardware design and the software development. I hope that this class will provide me with more tools that I can use in my embedded career. Outside of school I play cello in a local orchestra, I enjoy hiking, and I love to play videogames.
