I have previously taken Embedded Systems (ECE 3430), Computer Architecture (ECE 4435), Dependable Computing Systems (ECE 4434) and I am currently enrolled in ECE Capstone and Operating Systems. Outside of these classes, I also completed a research project as a part of Ben Calhoun's lab to build and programmed a tool to display a heat map of available power density using a Raspberri Pi for applications in IoT and self-powered systems. My previous experience with embedded technology includes the MSP430 microcontroller, C/C++ programming, Python programming, and Java programming.  
As an electrical & computer engineering major, I'm interested in the intersection of hardware and software and am especially interested in IoT applications. I love programming and building systems that solve problems and am motivated by the prevelence of embdedded systems in our lives. Through this class, I hope to learn how to design and build an embedded system. I loved taking ECE 3430, so I am hoping to dive deeper and strengthen my understanding of C programming and embedded technology. I am also looking forward to learning about applications in CPS and IoT throughout the second half of the semester, as these are topics I have always been interested in. I am excited for our class discussions about new research in these areas.
