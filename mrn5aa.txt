Your background in embedded systems design and programming, including any
previous embedded systems, computer architecture, or operating systems courses
that you have taken, relevant projects you have done, and any micro-controllers,
embedded platforms, and programming languages you have used.
I have taken and TA'd for Embedded computing Robotics I and II.  I took ECE comp arch, but I have not taken operating systems.
I have used C and C++ in classes
I am interested in autonomous driving and programming microcontrollers. I hope to gain an understanding of real time
systems for embedded and to learn more about cyber physical systems.
