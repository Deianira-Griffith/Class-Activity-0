Bassam Mohmaud - bm7tu

I took ECR 1 and currently enrolled into ECR 2. In these classes, we work with the
micro processor TI MSP432 to build a robot that Completes various functions.
For example: Last semester we configred light and bumb senseors as well as motors for
the robot so that it would be able to follow a line on the floor.
I also tinkered with arduino and Raspberry Pi a while ago.

I enrolled into this class because I'm a CPE Major and wanted more hands on exprience 
with microprocessors and embedded systems. The class curriculum seems interesting and 
full of topics I would like to know more about.
