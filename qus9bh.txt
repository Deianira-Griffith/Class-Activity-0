I have studied embedded systems, C++ programming, engineering modeling and power electronics technology at Chongqing University. Then, I also studied operating systemï¼Œ Digital signal processing and computer architecture at University of Cincinnati.
I think the fun of learning embedded systems is that we can design control circuits after we have completed systematic learning.
