Background:
To be completely transparent, my work with embedded systems is quite limited. The only experience I have is due to my enrollment in ECE 3430 in which we were introduced to embedded systems. While enrolled in
the class we worked with the MSP430 microcontroller which required code in C and at times assembly.
Interests:
I am extremely excited to dive deeper into embedded systems and how they work together/concurrently to provide for solutions to real world problems. I would say that my interests are more aligned with that
of a programmer but am very open-minded to broadening my expertise.
