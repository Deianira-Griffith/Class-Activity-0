Previously, I have taken a course in embedded systems prototyping, computer architecture, and operating systems during my undergraduate program. I have almost exclusively worked with the MSP430 architecture before a couple of years ago. While creating a sensor network I wrote drivers for peripheral hardware and abstraction layers to make writing software for the MSP430 more approachable and quicker. I now work with ARM chips and boards for the most part. Though I know enough ARM assembly to read it and write minimal chunks of code with it, I do not often interact with it. Other programming languages I have worked with most relevant to systems programming: C, C++, and Rust.
My interests include writing, designing, and improving systems software targeted toward embedded systems. Those improvements could be in energy efficiency, performance, security, or many other ways. My expectation is that this class will allow me to allocate more of my time at UVA to broadening my experience with embedded systems with some room for learning and experimentation.
